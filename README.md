# Chiptuner-0.6.2
![](infos/Chiptuner-062.jpg)

Friendly Greetings! This is my second attempt to make blank plates for VCV Rack! I have been inspired by [Omri Cohen](https://bit.ly/2P2watb) so a big thank go to him!

The technical part (coding, understanding how stuffs work) is given by [David O'Rourke](https://github.com/david-c14), [Clement Foulc](https://github.com/cfoulc/cf) and [VCV Rack](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack) since I've mostly "steal" all the informations from them!

Chiptuner-0.6.2 Xmas Edition is available for free. Feel free to download it, use it, redistribute it as you will.
If you are thinking to earn some money from it, please at least drop me a message and say "thank you"! I'd appreciate it!

Just added a new plate and changed some picture.

Oh, and put a reference for old C64 gamers like me! If you spotted it and recognized it, drop me a line here or in the VCV RACK group in Facebook! I will be very pleased to meet another hard core gamer!

Yeah, because it takes a really hard core gamer to spot the loving obeisance to the fabulous era of C64 games!

If something is wrong or not working properly, please let me know!

Have fun!
