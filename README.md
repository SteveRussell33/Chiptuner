# Chiptuner-0.6.2
![](infos/Chiptuner-062.jpg)

Friendly Greetings! This is my very first attempt to make blank plates for VCV Rack! I have been inspired by [Omri Cohen](https://bit.ly/2P2watb) so a big thank go to him!

The technical part (coding, understanding how stuffs work) is given by [David O'Rourke](https://github.com/david-c14), [Clement Foulc](https://github.com/cfoulc/cf) and [VCV Rack](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack) since I've mostly "steal" all the informations from them!

Chiptuner-0.6.2 collection is available for free. Feel free to download it, use it, redistribute it as you will.
If you are thinking to earn some money from it, please at least drop me a message and say "thank you"! I'd appreciate it!

Have fun!
